## Abstract
Predicting Apple stock market trends using probabilistic models can assist investors in making informed decisions, mitigating financial risks, and optimizing investment strategies. This work proposes an AI agent utilizing the PEAS framework, evaluating performance through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability. The agent operates in financial markets, using sensors (e.g., market indicators such as opening price, high, low, volume, and percentage change) to analyze historical stock data and actuators (e.g., buy, sell, or hold recommendations) to guide investment decisions. This work explores Bayesian networks (modeling relationships between stock indicators via probability distributions), Hidden Markov Models (capturing market state transitions such as bullish and bearish trends), and hybrid approaches integrating probabilistic reasoning with machine learning. The prediction tasks focus on classifying quarterly price changes into categories (e.g., increase or decrease) and further categorizing the magnitude of change as small or large. Challenges include handling market volatility, ensuring model robustness against sudden economic shifts, and addressing ethical concerns related to algorithmic trading and investor reliance on AI predictions. By balancing predictive accuracy with financial ethics, the agent could provide a data-driven approach to stock market trend classification.
