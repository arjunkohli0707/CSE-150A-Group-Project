## Abstract
Early prediction of diabetes using probabilistic models can help identify at-risk individuals, enabling timely lifestyle changes or medical care to reduce long-term health complications and lower costs for individuals and healthcare systems. This work proposes an AI agent using the PEAS framework, evaluating performance via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability. The agent operates in healthcare environments, using sensors (e.g., medical devices) to collect patient data and actuators (e.g., test results) to generate diagnoses. This work aims to build a model that predicts diabetes status from symptoms, exploring methods like Bayesian networks (modeling symptom relationships via conditional probability tables), Hidden Markov Models (capturing temporal patterns in health data), and hybrid approaches combining machine learning. Challenges include addressing data privacy and securing patient consent while prioritizing accessibility for underserved communities. By balancing technical simplicity and ethical considerations, the agent could provide a Machine Learning-based solution for early diabetes detection.
